🌍 DecentraClimate
A Decentralized Climate Intelligence & Action Platform

Track the planet. Organize the people. Act with data.

DecentraClimate is a one-stop, decentralized climate change platform that combines real-time environmental intelligence, AI-powered tools, and a community-driven social network to enable informed discussion, collective action, and measurable environmental impact.

This is not just a monitoring app.
This is climate infrastructure for the digital age.

🚀 Why DecentraClimate?

Climate change is not a single problem—it is a systemic crisis involving air, water, waste, policy, and public behavior.

Most platforms:

Show data

Stop there

DecentraClimate goes further:

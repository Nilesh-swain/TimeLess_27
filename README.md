> **Track the planet. Organize the people. Act with data.**

ECOPULSE is a **one-stop, decentralized climate change platform** that integrates **real-time environmental intelligence**, **AI-powered tools**, and a **community-driven social network** to enable informed discussion, collective action, and measurable environmental impact.

This is not just a monitoring app.  
This is **climate infrastructure for the digital age**.

## 🚀 Why ECOPULSE?

Climate change is a **systems-level crisis** involving air, water, waste, public behavior, and policy.

Most platforms only display environmental data.  
**ECOPULSE goes further by enabling prediction, action, and collective mobilization.**
